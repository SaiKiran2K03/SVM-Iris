# SVM-Iris
Created a support vector Test on the Standard Iris Dataset
*************
In this project, we have created a support vector test on the standard Iris dataset. This involves using an SVM algorithm to build a model that can accurately classify the different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The results of this test demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of SVMs in handling complex classification tasks. We hope that this project serves as a useful example for others looking to apply SVMs to their own datasets.
